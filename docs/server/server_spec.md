# Lemonade Server Spec

The Lemonade Server is a standards-compliant server process that provides an HTTP API to enable integration with other applications.

Lemonade Server currently supports these backends:

| Backend                                                                 | Model Format | Description                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)    | `.GGUF`      | Uses llama.cpp's `llama-server` backend. More details [here](#gguf-support).                    |
| [ONNX Runtime GenAI (OGA)](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai) | `.ONNX`      | Uses Lemonade's own `ryzenai-server` backend.                                                |
| [FastFlowLM](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM)    | `.q4nx`      | Uses FLM's `flm serve` backend. More details [here](#fastflowlm-support).                    |
| [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) | `.bin` | Uses whisper.cpp's `whisper-server` backend for audio transcription. Models: Whisper-Tiny, Whisper-Base, Whisper-Small. |
| [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) | `.safetensors` | Uses sd.cpp's `sd-cli` backend for image generation. Models: SD-Turbo, SDXL-Turbo, etc. |
| [Kokoros](https://github.com/lucasjinreal/Kokoros) | `.onnx` | Uses Kokoro's `koko` backend for speech generation. Models: kokoro-v1 |


## Endpoints Overview

The [key endpoints of the OpenAI API](#openai-compatible-endpoints) are available.

We are also actively investigating and developing [additional endpoints](#lemonade-specific-endpoints) that will improve the experience of local applications.

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints
- POST `/api/v1/chat/completions` - Chat Completions (messages -> completion)
- POST `/api/v1/completions` - Text Completions (prompt -> completion)
- POST `/api/v1/embeddings` - Embeddings (text -> vector representations)
- POST `/api/v1/responses` - Chat Completions (prompt|messages -> event)
- POST `/api/v1/audio/transcriptions` - Audio Transcription (audio -> text)
- POST `/api/v1/audio/speech` - Text to speech (text -> audio)
- POST `/api/v1/images/generations` - Image Generation (prompt -> image)
- GET `/api/v1/models` - List models available locally
- GET `/api/v1/models/{model_id}` - Retrieve a specific model by ID

### llama.cpp Endpoints

These endpoints defined by `llama.cpp` extend the OpenAI-compatible API with additional functionality.

- POST `/api/v1/reranking` - Reranking (query + documents -> relevance-scored documents)

### Lemonade-Specific Endpoints

We have designed a set of Lemonade-specific endpoints to enable client applications by extending the existing cloud-focused APIs (e.g., OpenAI). These extensions allow for a greater degree of UI/UX responsiveness in native applications by allowing applications to:

- Download models at setup time.
- Pre-load models at UI-loading-time, as opposed to completion-request time.
- Unload models to save memory space.
- Understand system resources and state to make dynamic choices.

The additional endpoints are:

- POST `/api/v1/pull` - Install a model
- POST `/api/v1/delete` - Delete a model
- POST `/api/v1/load` - Load a model
- POST `/api/v1/unload` - Unload a model
- GET `/api/v1/health` - Check server status, such as models loaded
- GET `/api/v1/stats` - Performance statistics from the last request
- GET `/api/v1/system-info` - System information and device enumeration
- GET `/live` - Check server liveness for load balancers and orchestrators

## Multi-Model Support

Lemonade Server supports loading multiple models simultaneously, allowing you to keep frequently-used models in memory for faster switching. The server uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache policy to automatically manage model eviction when limits are reached.

### Configuration

Use the `--max-loaded-models` option to specify how many models to keep loaded per type slot:

```bash
# Allow up to 5 models of each type (5 LLMs, 5 embedding, 5 reranking, 5 audio, 5 image)
lemonade-server serve --max-loaded-models 5

# Unlimited models (no LRU eviction)
lemonade-server serve --max-loaded-models -1
```

**Default:** `1` (one model of each type). Use `-1` for unlimited.

### Model Types

Models are categorized into these types:
- **LLM** - Chat and completion models (default type)
- **Embedding** - Models for generating text embeddings (identified by the `embeddings` label)
- **Reranking** - Models for document reranking (identified by the `reranking` label)
- **Audio** - Models for audio transcription using Whisper (identified by the `audio` label)
- **Image** - Models for image generation (identified by the `image` label)

Each type has its own independent LRU cache, all sharing the same slot limit set by `--max-loaded-models`.

### Device Constraints

- **NPU Exclusivity:** Only one model can use the NPU at a time. Loading a new NPU model will evict any existing NPU model regardless of type or limits.
- **CPU/GPU:** No inherent limits beyond available RAM. Multiple models can coexist on CPU or GPU.

### Eviction Policy

When a model slot is full:
1. The least recently used model of that type is evicted
2. The new model is loaded
3. If loading fails (except file-not-found errors), all models are evicted and the load is retried

Models currently processing inference requests cannot be evicted until they finish.

### Per-Model Settings

Each model can be loaded with custom settings (context size, llamacpp backend, llamacpp args) via the `/api/v1/load` endpoint. These per-model settings override the default values set via CLI arguments or environment variables. See the [`/api/v1/load` endpoint documentation](#post-apiv1load) for details.

**Setting Priority Order:**
1. Values passed explicitly in `/api/v1/load` request (highest priority)
2. Values from `lemonade-server` CLI arguments or environment variables
3. Hardcoded defaults in `lemonade-router` (lowest priority)

## Start the HTTP Server

> **NOTE:** This server is intended for use on local systems only. Do not expose the server port to the open internet.

See the [Lemonade Server getting started instructions](./README.md).

```bash
lemonade-server serve
```

#### Streaming Events

The Responses API uses semantic events for streaming. Each event is typed with a predefined schema, so you can listen for events you care about. Our initial implementation only offers support to:

- `response.created`
- `response.output_text.delta`
- `response.completed`

For a full list of event types, see the [API reference for streaming](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming).

## Additional Endpoints

### `POST /api/v1/pull` <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Register and install models for use with Lemonade Server.

#### Parameters

The Lemonade Server built-in model registry has a collection of model names that can be pulled and loaded. The `pull` endpoint can install any registered model, and it can also register-then-install any model available on Hugging Face.

**Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `stream` | No | If `true`, returns Server-Sent Events (SSE) with download progress. Defaults to `false`. |

**Install a Model that is Already Registered**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | [Lemonade Server model name](https://lemonade-server.ai/models.html) to install. |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
  }'
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Installed model: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-CPU"
}
```

In case of an error, the status will be `error` and the message will contain the error message.

**Register and Install a Model**

Registration will place an entry for that model in the `user_models.json` file, which is located in the user's Lemonade cache (default: `~/.cache/lemonade`). Then, the model will be installed. Once the model is registered and installed, it will show up in the `models` endpoint alongside the built-in models and can be loaded.

The `recipe` field defines which software framework and device will be used to load and run the model. For more information on OGA and Hugging Face recipes, see the [Lemonade API README](../lemonade_api.md). For information on GGUF recipes, see [llamacpp](#gguf-support).

> Note: the `model_name` for registering a new model must use the `user` namespace, to prevent collisions with built-in models. For example, `user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF`.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Yes | Namespaced [Lemonade Server model name](https://lemonade-server.ai/models.html) to register and install. |
| `checkpoint` | Yes | HuggingFace checkpoint to install. |
| `recipe` | Yes | Lemonade API recipe to load the model with. |
| `reasoning` | No | Whether the model is a reasoning model, like DeepSeek (default: false). Adds 'reasoning' label. |
| `vision` | No | Whether the model has vision capabilities for processing images (default: false). Adds 'vision' label. |
| `embedding` | No | Whether the model is an embedding model (default: false). Adds 'embeddings' label. |
| `reranking` | No | Whether the model is a reranking model (default: false). Adds 'reranking' label. |
| `mmproj` | No | Multimodal Projector (mmproj) file to use for vision models. |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pull \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_name": "user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF",
    "checkpoint": "unsloth/Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF:Q4_K_M",
    "recipe": "llamacpp"
  }'
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "status":"success",
  "message":"Installed model: user.Phi-4-Mini-GGUF"
}
```

In case of an error, the status will be `error` and the message will contain the error message.

#### Streaming Response (stream=true)

When `stream=true`, the endpoint returns Server-Sent Events with real-time download progress:

```
event: progress
data: {"file":"model.gguf","file_index":1,"total_files":2,"bytes_downloaded":1073741824,"bytes_total":2684354560,"percent":40}

**Setting Priority:**

When loading a model, settings are applied in this priority order:
1. Values explicitly passed in the `load` request (highest priority)
2. Per-model values configurable in `recipe_options.json` (see below for details)
3. Values set via `lemonade-server` CLI arguments or environment variables
4. Default hardcoded values in `lemonade-router` (lowest priority)

#### Per-model options

You can configure recipe-specific options on a per-model basis. Lemonade manages a file called `recipe_options.json` in the user's Lemonade cache (default: `~/.cache/lemonade`). The available options depend on the model's recipe:

```json
{
  "user.Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct": {
    "ctx_size": 16384,
    "llamacpp_backend": "vulkan",
    "llamacpp_args": "-np 2 -kvu"
  },
  "Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF" : {
    "llamacpp_backend": "rocm"
  },
  "whisper-large-v3-turbo-q8_0.bin": {
    "whispercpp_backend": "npu"
  }
}
```

Note that model names include any applicable prefix, such as `user.` and `extra.`.

# Debugging

To help debug the Lemonade server, you can use the `--log-level` parameter to control the verbosity of logging information. The server supports multiple logging levels that provide increasing amounts of detail about server operations.

```
lemonade-server serve --log-level [level]
```

Where `[level]` can be one of:

- **critical**: Only critical errors that prevent server operation.
- **error**: Error conditions that might allow continued operation.
- **warning**: Warning conditions that should be addressed.
- **info**: (Default) General informational messages about server operation.
- **debug**: Detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting, including metrics such as input/output token counts, Time To First Token (TTFT), and Tokens Per Second (TPS).
- **trace**: Very detailed tracing information, including everything from debug level plus all input prompts.

# GGUF Support

The `llama-server` backend works with Lemonade's suggested `*-GGUF` models, as well as any .gguf model from Hugging Face. Windows and Ubuntu Linux are supported. Details:
- Lemonade Server wraps `llama-server` with support for the `lemonade-server` CLI, client web app, and endpoints (e.g., `models`, `pull`, `load`, etc.).
  - The `chat/completions`, `completions`, `embeddings`, and `reranking` endpoints are supported.
  - The `embeddings` endpoint requires embedding-specific models (e.g., nomic-embed-text models).
  - The `reranking` endpoint requires reranker-specific models (e.g., bge-reranker models).
  - `responses` is not supported at this time.
- A single Lemonade Server process can seamlessly switch between GGUF, ONNX, and FastFlowLM models.
  - Lemonade Server will attempt to load models onto GPU with Vulkan first, and if that doesn't work it will fall back to CPU.
  - From the end-user's perspective, OGA vs. GGUF should be completely transparent: they wont be aware of whether the built-in server or `llama-server` is serving their model.

## Installing GGUF Models

To install an arbitrary GGUF from Hugging Face, open the Lemonade web app by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser, click the Model Management tab, and use the Add a Model form.

## Platform Support Matrix

| Platform | GPU Acceleration | CPU Architecture |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Windows  | ✅ Vulkan, ROCm        | ✅ x64           |
| Ubuntu   | ✅ Vulkan, ROCm        | ✅ x64           |
| Other Linux | ⚠️* Vulkan    | ⚠️* x64          |

*Other Linux distributions may work but are not officially supported.

# FastFlowLM Support

Similar to the [llama-server support](#gguf-support), Lemonade can also route OpenAI API requests to a FastFlowLM `flm serve` backend.

The `flm serve` backend works with Lemonade's suggested `*-FLM` models, as well as any model mentioned in `flm list`. Windows is the only supported operating system. Details:
- Lemonade Server wraps `flm serve` with support for the `lemonade-server` CLI, client web app, and all Lemonade custom endpoints (e.g., `pull`, `load`, etc.).
  - OpenAI API endpoints supported: `models`, `chat/completions` (streaming), and `embeddings`.
  - The `embeddings` endpoint requires embedding-specific models supported by FLM.
- A single Lemonade Server process can seamlessly switch between FLM, OGA, and GGUF models.

## Installing FLM Models

To install an arbitrary FLM model:
1. `flm list` to view the supported models.
1. Open the Lemonade web app by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser, click the Model Management tab, and use the Add a Model form.
1. Use the model name from `flm list` as the "checkpoint name" in the Add a Model form and select "flm" as the recipe.
